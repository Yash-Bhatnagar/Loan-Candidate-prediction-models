# Loan-Candidate-prediction-models
<h3>Business Context:</h3>
<p>This case is about a 'XYZ' bank whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.</p>
